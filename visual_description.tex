The Main method enters a While-Loop in which the user is tasked with entering a year. The input throws an exception if the input can't be converted to an int, or if the year is smaller than or equal to 1582. When a valid input has been made, the IsLeapYear method checks if the year is divisible by 4, and if it either: can't be divided by 100, or can be divided by 400. If it returns true "yay" is printed, and if false is returned "nay" is printed.
